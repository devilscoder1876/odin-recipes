    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>German apple cake is a moist, dense cake that keeps well. It has been a family favorite for 20 years. Serve with a dusting of confectioners' sugar or topped with a cream cheese frosting.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 cups apples - peeled, cored and diced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch cake pan.</li>
        <li>Beat oil and eggs in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add sugar and vanilla; beat well.</li>
        <li>Stir together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Slowly add flour mixture to egg mixture; mix until combined. The batter will be very thick. Fold in apples by hand using a wooden spoon. Spread batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake cake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool cake on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
